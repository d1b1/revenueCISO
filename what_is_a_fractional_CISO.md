<p class="fs-5">
    Someone you can call to de-risk your cybersecurity issues.
</p>

<p class="fs-5">
    Having a trusted reference, who knows your company and can help your organization
    build a culture of security and trust.
</p>

<p class="fs-5">
    My mission is to help companies build trust as a core strength. SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR,
    is all about making external stakeholders happy. Building trust is about making your 
    team feel empowered to own their security.

    Why me? 
    <small class="text-body-secondary" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200;">(...when I was an active founder)</small>
</h3>

<p class="fs-5">
    When I was a venture-backed founder, I was facing the same issues that I see every day.
    Security is a drop-in solution. I found that no matter how hard I worked, getting team
    buy-in was hard. Keeping security front of mind was a challenge.
</p>

<p class="fs-5">
    My last company had tons of PHI and PII data. We were testing thousands of people
    for COVID-19 using diagnostic testing protocols. All that data was sensitive. We tested
    the entire US Olympic Teams, as well as Canada and Mexico. We needed data that was mobile.
    Meaning we needed to support <b>diagnostic health at scale</b>, while empowering HIPAA-safe patterns
    in our staff and our customers.
</p>

<p class="fs-5">
    At the same time, I was watching the year-long run-up to the Russia-Ukraine War in 2022. I was worried.
    I needed to build a business, protect the data, and train a team to do the same. I was not alone
    in having fear. Leading up to the war, which started the first time I took a vacation in 5 years,
    tech founders were expecting massive cyber warfare originating in Russia.
</p>

<p class="fs-5">
    I realized that a rules-based and top down approach would not work. This started my journey
    as a CTO who wears a CISO hat. I know people. I know teams. And I know how to help teams
    bake good cybersecurity hygiene into their teams.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-5">
    Go it Alone?
</h2>

<p class="fs-5">
    Yes, you can do it. By why. If I could have hired a fCISO in 2020, I would have saved myself
    and my team a lot of false starts, meetings, endless blog articles and more. I offer teams
    a trusted and accessible resource that meets their goals.
